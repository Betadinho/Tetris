# tetris-clone

Very simple Tetris clone built with vanilla JavaScript following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEsAr2Yt2do " Build Tetris game with JS on Youtube") by [ Code Explained](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8n8ftV94ZU_DJLOLtrpORA).

Some of the pieces (tetrominoes) are displayed in a weird color or with other artifacts only in the demo gif!
I guess it has to be some compression issue, I have no clue though. :)
